# Projekt1-Linh-Zala-CVD
Cardiovascular Disease Projekt

# Intro:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading cause of death world wide, making up a third of deaths globally. In the current project we explored risk factors for CVD and CVD prevalences in two different datasets obtained in India and the USA.

# Data:
For the current project we used 4 different data sources, including two datasets from Kaggle, and 2 tables scraped from Wikipedia.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/cardiovascular-disease-dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol

The two datasets varied in method of data aquisition (Hospital vs Survey), country of aquisition (India vs USA) and sample size (N = 1000 vs N = 253680). The dataset collected in the USA contained mostly quantitative varaibles, while the dataset from India contained some quantitative and some qualitative data.

# We tried two answer the following questions:
What are the key factors influencing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across different populations, and how do factors such as geographical region, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and income level correlate with CVD risk?

# Steps taken
- scraped norm-tables from Wikipedia (blood pressure, plasma cholesterol)
- checked the data for missings, odd values, and outliers
- recoded columns to be able to compare varaibles between datasets
- concatenated the two datasets
- analyzed the data with respect to our hypotheses
- created plots to visualize the results

# Conclusions
- The method of data aquisition has an influence on the representativeness of the data.
- Individuals with high resting blood pressure and individuals higher plasma cholesterol levels are more likely to have CVD (India dataset).
- CVD is more prevalent in smokers than non-smokers, and more prevalent in individuals with lower vs higher income (US dataset).


# Further Questions
Can CVD diagnosis be predicted based on risk factors like smoking, high blood pressure, etc?
